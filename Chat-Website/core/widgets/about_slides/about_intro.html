	<h2>About me</h2>
	<hr />
	<b>Hi there!</b><br /><p>
	My name is Felix Ekdahl, a 19 year old Computer Scientist-to be! I'm about to start my second year at Link&ouml;pings University of Technology, Sweden.
	I'm completely in love with computer programming! Since I was about eleven years old I started hacking my way through a small game server that I had managed to
	get the source code for.<p>That was when my interest awakened, I realized that I was able to do something useful to others. I began to expand 
	my knowledge by effectively reading about pretty much anything programming related.<p>
	I had this going on for quite a while before I got into high school where I studied Science with Mathematics and Computers where my Java roots began to spread, as a passionate
	programmer I took my exam by the summer 2012 with the highest grades possible in all programming related subjects. Infused with confidence, I decided to send an application for the
	Computer Science Program at LiTH, Link&ouml;ping where I'm currently studying.
