	<h2>The Chat!</h2>
	<hr />
	<h3>Why so chatty?</h3>
	There are a couple of reasons I decided to develop a chat application.<p>
	The first and most important one:
	<dd><b>It is easy to work on and to expand and shows my sufficiency on working with concurrent applications.</b></dd><p>
	Secondly, A chat application can run on many platforms such as, say the Mobile platform for example, this opens pathways to exporting the project to a mobile application as well.<p>
	<h4>Chat Technologies</h4>
	The chat is using a couple of technologies.<br>
	I will go through them here step by step and try to explain their purpose as thoroughly as possible.<p>
	<dt>
		<dd>
			<b><u>Java</u></b><br />
			Java is the language the Server and Client is programmed with. The reason why I chose Java is because it is the language I 
			have the greatest experience with and feel most comfortable working with.
		</dd><p>
		<dd>
			<b><u>Netty</u></b>
			The networking library of my choice. <br />Netty is an asynchronous(multithreaded) networking library with high performance and the one I have most experience working with.
			For this task I'm using the TCP netowork protocol only. UDP can be considered in the future if I will update the application and add some functionality such as camchat or voice chats.
		</dd><p>
		<dd>
		<b><u>MySQL</u></b>
			The Server communicates with a MySQL Database for user querying and the settings for the server such as the port number, message of the day,
			the client version and the key to complete the handshake between server-client.
		</dd><p>
		<dd><b><u>PHP</u></b>
			This very website you're currently reading is made using PHP. Although the website should have been built in java as well, other non-programming related obstacles came in the way, making PHP the export decision.
