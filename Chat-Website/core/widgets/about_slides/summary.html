	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<hr />
	
	In this very simple slide presentation I have gone through some of the basic concepts used during the development of this project.
	<p>The purpose of this project is to work as a portfolio and of course to learn more about multithreaded programming.
	I will list what I believe I have shown as strong skills with and hopefully strong enough.
	
	<ul>
		<li>I believe I have great skills with Java and different paradigms used in programming such as <b>Object Oriented Programming</b>.
		<li>I am proficient with PHP and understands the fundamentals in which PHP operates on a server-side basis.</li>
		<li>I can handle and setup a MySQL database and maintain queries and interactions between different applications.</li>
		<li>And, last but not least, the reason that this website is completely written in English, is to show my proficiency with the language.</li>
	</ul>
	
	General information about the project;
	<dt>
		<dd>Took about 40 hours to complete from scratch.</dd><p>
		<dd>Everything (except the libraries), including the website, is written by me.</dd><p>
		<dd>There is still some documentation missing in the project, but most is documented and the function and variable names make sense.</dd><p>
		<dd>The project is <a href="https://github.com/Codesane/Chat-Application">open source.</a></dd>
